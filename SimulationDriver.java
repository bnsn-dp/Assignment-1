	 * 	3) randomly generate a number students and the answers;
	 * 	4) submit all the studentsâ€™ answers to iVote Service;
	 * 	5) call the Voting Service output function to display the result.
	 * 
	 * You can randomly generate the IDs and answers for a group of students 
	 * to simulate the submission process and check the results.
